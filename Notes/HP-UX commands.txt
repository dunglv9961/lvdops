Basic network commands

If you use ifconfig you must specify an interface to see its configuration.
# ifconfig lan0

If you just want to see ip addresses for all interfaces:
# netstat -in














An LVM system starts by initializing disks for LVM usage. An LVM disk is known as a physical volume (PV).

Physical volumes are organized into volume groups (VGs). A volume group can consist of one or more physical volumes, and there can be more than one volume group in the system.

The pool of disk space that is represented by a volume group can be divided into logical volumes (LVs) of various sizes.

Starting with volume group Version 2.2, LVM introduced a new type of logical volume: snapshot logical volume. Snapshots are point-in-time image of a logical volume. Snapshots allow you to create another copy of the logical volume (which can be used for a backup) without taking up as much of the physical space as the size of the logical volume.
