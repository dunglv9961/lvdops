Basic network commands

If you use ifconfig you must specify an interface to see its configuration.
# ifconfig lan0

If you just want to see ip addresses for all interfaces:
# netstat -in














An LVM system starts by initializing disks for LVM usage. An LVM disk is known as a physical volume (PV).

Physical volumes are organized into volume groups (VGs). A volume group can consist of one or more physical volumes, and there can be more than one volume group in the system.

The pool of disk space that is represented by a volume group can be divided into logical volumes (LVs) of various sizes.
