[26/06/2017 02:36:19 PM]  DESCRIPTION
[26/06/2017 02:36:19 PM]       For each directory argument, the ls command lists the contents of the
[26/06/2017 02:36:19 PM]       directory.  For each file argument, ls repeats its name and any other
[26/06/2017 02:36:19 PM]       information requested.  The output is sorted in ascending collation
[26/06/2017 02:36:19 PM]       order by default (see Environment Variables below).  When no argument
[26/06/2017 02:36:19 PM]       is given, the current directory is listed.  When several arguments are
[26/06/2017 02:36:19 PM]       given, the arguments are first sorted appropriately, but file
[26/06/2017 02:36:19 PM]       arguments appear before directories and their contents.
[26/06/2017 02:36:19 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:19 PM]       If you are a user with appropriate privileges, all files except . and
[26/06/2017 02:36:19 PM]       .. are listed by default.
[26/06/2017 02:36:19 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:19 PM]       There are three major listing formats.  The format chosen depends on
[26/06/2017 02:36:19 PM]       whether the output is going to a login device (determined by whether
[26/06/2017 02:36:19 PM]       output device file is a tty device), and can also be controlled by
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM]       option flags.
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM]       The default format for a login device is to list the contents of
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM]       directories in multicolumn format, with entries sorted vertically by
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM]       column.  (When individual file names (as opposed to directory names)
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM]       appear in the argument list, those file names are always sorted across
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM]       the page rather than down the page in columns because individual file
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM]       names can be arbitrarily long.) If the standard output is not a login
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM]       device, the default format is to list one entry per line.
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM]       The -C and -x options enable multicolumn formats, and the -m option
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM]       enables stream output format in which files are listed across the
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM]       page, separated by commas.  In order to determine output formats for
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM]       the -C, -x, and -m options, ls uses an environment variable, COLUMNS,
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM]       to determine the number of character positions available on each
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM]       output line.  If this variable is not set, the terminfo database is
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM]       used to determine the number of columns, based on the environment
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM]       variable TERM.  If this information cannot be obtained, 80 columns is
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM]       assumed.
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM]       The command lc functions the same as ls except that the lc default
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM]       output is columnar, even if output is redirected.

[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM]     Options
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM]       ls recognizes the following options:
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM]            -a   List all entries; usually entries whose names begin with a
[26/06/2017 02:36:23 PM]                 period (.) are not listed.
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM]            -b   List nonprinting characters in the octal \ddd notation.
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM]            -c   Use time of last modification of the inode (file created,
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM]                 mode changed, etc.) for sorting (-t) or printing (-l (ell)).
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM]            -d   If an argument is a directory, list only its name (not its
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM]                 contents); often used with -l (ell) to get the status of a
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM]                 directory.
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM]                 Under the UNIX 2003 environment (see standards(5)), ls with
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM]                 -d does not follow symbolic links unless the -H or -L option
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM]                 is specified.
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM]            -e   List the extent attributes of the file.  If any of the files
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM]                 has a extent attribute, this option lists the extent size,
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM]                 space reserved and allocation flags.  This option must be
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM]                 used with the -l (ell) option.
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM]            -f   Interpret each argument as a directory and list the name
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM]                 found in each slot.  This option disables -l (ell), -r, -s,
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM]                 and -t, and enables -a; the order is the order in which
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM]                 entries appear in the directory.
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM]            -g   Same as -l (ell), except that only the group is printed
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM]                 (owner is omitted).  If both -l (ell) and -g are specified,
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM]                 the owner is not printed.
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM]            -i   For each file, list the inode number in the first column of
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM]                 the report.  When used in multicolumn output, the number
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM]                 precedes the file name in each column.
[26/06/2017 02:36:24 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:28 PM]            -l   (ell) List in long format, giving mode, number of links,
[26/06/2017 02:36:28 PM]                 owner, group, size in bytes, and time of last modification
[26/06/2017 02:36:28 PM]                 for each file (see further DESCRIPTION and Access Control
[26/06/2017 02:36:28 PM]                 Lists below).  If the time of last modification is greater
[26/06/2017 02:36:28 PM]                 than six months ago, or any time in the future, the year is
[26/06/2017 02:36:28 PM]                 substituted for the hour and minute of the modification
[26/06/2017 02:36:28 PM]                 time.  If the file is a special file, the size field
[26/06/2017 02:36:28 PM]                 contains the major and minor device numbers rather than a
[26/06/2017 02:36:28 PM]                 size.  If the file is a symbolic link, the filename is
[26/06/2017 02:36:28 PM]                 printed, followed by -> and the pathname of the referenced
[26/06/2017 02:36:28 PM]                 file.
[26/06/2017 02:36:28 PM]

[26/06/2017 02:36:28 PM]                 group's GID numbers are printed, rather than the associated
[26/06/2017 02:36:28 PM]                 character strings.
[26/06/2017 02:36:28 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:28 PM]            -o   The same as -l, (ell) except that only the owner is printed
[26/06/2017 02:36:28 PM]                 (group is omitted).  (If both -l (ell) and -o are specified,
[26/06/2017 02:36:28 PM]                 the group is not printed).

[26/06/2017 02:36:30 PM]                 blocks, for each entry.  The first entry listed is the total
[26/06/2017 02:36:30 PM]                 number of blocks in the directory.  When used in multicolumn
[26/06/2017 02:36:30 PM]                 output, the number of blocks precedes the file name in each
[26/06/2017 02:36:30 PM]                 column.  The number of indirect blocks in a file is
[26/06/2017 02:36:30 PM]                 filesystem dependent.
[26/06/2017 02:36:30 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:30 PM]            -t   Sort by time modified (latest first) before sorting

[26/06/2017 02:36:30 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:30 PM]            -u   Use time of last access instead of last modification for
[26/06/2017 02:36:30 PM]                 sorting (-t option) or printing (-l (ell) option).
[26/06/2017 02:36:30 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:30 PM]            -x   List multicolumn output with entries sorted across rather
[26/06/2017 02:36:30 PM]                 than down the page.
[26/06/2017 02:36:30 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:30 PM]            -A   The same as -a, except that the current directory . and
[26/06/2017 02:36:30 PM]                 parent directory .. are not listed.  For a user with
[26/06/2017 02:36:30 PM]                 appropriate privileges, this flag defaults to on, and is
[26/06/2017 02:36:30 PM]                 turned off by -A.

[26/06/2017 02:36:31 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:31 PM]                 Under the UNIX 2003 environment (see standards(5)), ls with
[26/06/2017 02:36:31 PM]                 -F does not follow symbolic links unless the -H or -L option
[26/06/2017 02:36:31 PM]                 is specified.
[26/06/2017 02:36:31 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:31 PM]            -H   If a symbolic link referencing a file of type directory is
[26/06/2017 02:36:31 PM]                 specified on the command line, ls evaluates the file
[26/06/2017 02:36:31 PM]                 information and file type to be those of the file referenced
[26/06/2017 02:36:31 PM]                 by the link, and not the link itself. However, ls writes the
[26/06/2017 02:36:31 PM]                 name of the link itself and not the file referenced by the
[26/06/2017 02:36:31 PM]                 link.
[26/06/2017 02:36:31 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:31 PM]            -L   Evaluate the file information and file type for all symbolic
[26/06/2017 02:36:31 PM]                 links (whether named on the command line or encountered in a
[26/06/2017 02:36:31 PM]                 file hierarchy) to be those of the file referenced by the
[26/06/2017 02:36:31 PM]                 link, and not the link itself.  However, ls writes the name
[26/06/2017 02:36:31 PM]                 of the link itself and not the file referenced by the link.
[26/06/2017 02:36:31 PM]                 When -L is used with -l, write the contents of symbolic
[26/06/2017 02:36:31 PM]                 links in the long format.
[26/06/2017 02:36:31 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM]            -R   Recursively list subdirectories encountered.
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM]            -1   (one) List the file names in single column format regardless
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM]                 of the output device.  This forces single column format to
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM]                 the user's terminal.
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM]       Specifying more than one of the options in the following mutually
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM]       exclusive pairs is not considered an error: -C and -l (ell), -m and -l
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM]       (ell), -x and -l (ell), -C and -1 (one), -H and -L, and -c and -u.
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM]       ls is known by several shorthand-version names for the various
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM]       formats:
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM]            l    is equivalent to ls -m
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM]            ll   is equivalent to ls -l (ell)
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM]            lsf  is equivalent to ls -F
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM]            lsr  is equivalent to ls -R
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM]            lsx  is equivalent to ls -x
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM]       The shorthand notations are implemented as links to ls.  Option
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM]       arguments to the shorthand versions behave exactly as if the long form
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM]       above had been used with the additional arguments.

[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM]       Mode Bits Interpretation (-l option)
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM]       The mode printed in listings produced by the -l (ell) option consists
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM]       of 10 characters, for example, -rwxr-xr-x.
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:33 PM]       The first character indicates the entry type:

[26/06/2017 02:36:34 PM]       The next 9 characters are interpreted as three sets of three
[26/06/2017 02:36:34 PM]       characters each which identify access and execution permissions for
[26/06/2017 02:36:34 PM]       the owner, group, and others categories, as described in chmod(1).
[26/06/2017 02:36:34 PM]       The - indicates the permission is not granted.  The various
[26/06/2017 02:36:34 PM]       permissions can be put together in any combination, except that the x,
[26/06/2017 02:36:34 PM]       s, S, t, and T characters are mutually exclusive, as implied below.
[26/06/2017 02:36:34 PM]

[26/06/2017 02:36:40 PM]     Access Control Lists (ACLs)
[26/06/2017 02:36:40 PM]       If a file has optional ACL entries, the -l (ell) option displays a
[26/06/2017 02:36:40 PM]       plus sign (+) after the file's permissions.  The permissions shown are
[26/06/2017 02:36:40 PM]       a summary representation of the file's access control list, as
[26/06/2017 02:36:40 PM]       returned by stat() in the st_mode field (see stat(2)).  To list the
[26/06/2017 02:36:40 PM]       contents of an access control list, use the lsacl command (see
[26/06/2017 02:36:40 PM]       lsacl(1) and acl(5)) for HFS file systems, or the getacl command (see
[26/06/2017 02:36:40 PM]       getacl(1) and aclv(5)) for JFS file systems.

[26/06/2017 02:36:40 PM]     Environment Variables
[26/06/2017 02:36:40 PM]       If the COLUMNS variable is set, ls uses the width provided in
[26/06/2017 02:36:40 PM]       determining positioning of columnar output.
[26/06/2017 02:36:40 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:40 PM]       LANG determines the locale to use for the locale categories when both
[26/06/2017 02:36:40 PM]       LC_ALL and the corresponding environment variable (beginning with LC_)
[26/06/2017 02:36:40 PM]       do not specify a locale.  If LANG is not set or is null, it defaults
[26/06/2017 02:36:40 PM]       to C (see lang(5)).
[26/06/2017 02:36:41 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:41 PM]       LC_COLLATE determines the order in which the output is sorted.
[26/06/2017 02:36:41 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:41 PM]       LC_CTYPE determines which characters are classified as nonprinting for
[26/06/2017 02:36:41 PM]       the -b and -q options, and the interpretation of single- and/or
[26/06/2017 02:36:41 PM]       multibyte characters within file names.
[26/06/2017 02:36:41 PM] 
[26/06/2017 02:36:41 PM]       LC_TIME determines the date and time strings output by the -g, -l
[26/06/2017 02:36:41 PM]       (ell), -n, and -o options.

[26/06/2017 02:36:43 PM]       Setting options based on whether the output is a login (tty) device is
[26/06/2017 02:36:43 PM]       undesirable because ls -s is very different from ls -s | lp.  On the
[26/06/2017 02:36:43 PM]       other hand, not using this setting makes old shell scripts that used
[26/06/2017 02:36:43 PM]       ls almost inevitably fail.

[26/06/2017 02:36:43 PM]       Nonprinting characters in file names (without the -b or -q option) may
