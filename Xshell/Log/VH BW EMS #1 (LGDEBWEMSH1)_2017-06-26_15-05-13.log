[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM] SYNOPSIS
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM]        useradd [options] LOGIN
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM]        useradd -D
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM]        useradd -D [options]
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM] DESCRIPTION
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM]        When invoked without the -D option, the useradd command creates a new user account using the values specified on the command line plus the default values from the
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM]        system. Depending on command line options, the useradd command will update system files and may also create the new user큦 home directory and copy initial files.
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM]        By default, a group will also be created for the new user (see -g, -N, -U, and USERGROUPS_ENAB).
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM] OPTIONS
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM]        The options which apply to the useradd command are:
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM]        -b, --base-dir BASE_DIR
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM]            The default base directory for the system if -d HOME_DIR is not specified.  BASE_DIR is concatenated with the account name to define the home directory. The
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM]            BASE_DIR must exist otherwise the home directory cannot be created.
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM]            If this option is not specified, useradd will use the base directory specified by the HOME variable in /etc/default/useradd, or /home by default.
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM]        -c, --comment COMMENT
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM]            Any text string. It is generally a short description of the login, and is currently used as the field for the user큦 full name.
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM]        -d, --home-dir HOME_DIR
[26/06/2017 03:05:52 PM]            The new user will be created using HOME_DIR as the value for the user큦 login directory. The default is to append the LOGIN name to BASE_DIR and use that as the
[26/06/2017 03:05:56 PM]            login directory name.
[26/06/2017 03:05:57 PM]

[26/06/2017 03:05:57 PM]        -e, --expiredate EXPIRE_DATE
[26/06/2017 03:05:58 PM]            The date on which the user account will be disabled. The date is specified in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
[26/06/2017 03:05:58 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:05:59 PM]            If not specified, useradd will use the default expiry date specified by the EXPIRE variable in /etc/default/useradd, or an empty string (no expiry) by default.
[26/06/2017 03:05:59 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:05:59 PM]        -f, --inactive INACTIVE
[26/06/2017 03:05:59 PM]            The number of days after a password expires until the account is permanently disabled. A value of 0 disables the account as soon as the password has expired,
[26/06/2017 03:05:59 PM]            and a value of -1 disables the feature.
[26/06/2017 03:05:59 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:05:59 PM]            If not specified, useradd will use the default inactivity period specified by the INACTIVE variable in /etc/default/useradd, or -1 by default.

[26/06/2017 03:06:00 PM]            The group name or number of the user큦 initial login group. The group name must exist. A group number must refer to an already existing group.
[26/06/2017 03:06:00 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:01 PM]            If not specified, the behavior of useradd will depend on the USERGROUPS_ENAB variable in /etc/login.defs. If this variable is set to yes (or -U/--user-group is
[26/06/2017 03:06:01 PM]            specified on the command line), a group will be created for the user, with the same name as her loginname. If the variable is set to no (or -N/--no-user-group
[26/06/2017 03:06:01 PM]            is specified on the command line), useradd will set the primary group of the new user to the value specified by the GROUP variable in /etc/default/useradd, or
[26/06/2017 03:06:01 PM]            100 by default.
[26/06/2017 03:06:02 PM]

[26/06/2017 03:06:02 PM]            A list of supplementary groups which the user is also a member of. Each group is separated from the next by a comma, with no intervening whitespace. The groups
[26/06/2017 03:06:02 PM]            are subject to the same restrictions as the group given with the -g option. The default is for the user to belong only to the initial group.

[26/06/2017 03:06:16 PM]            Example: -K PASS_MAX_DAYS=-1 can be used when creating system account to turn off password ageing, even though system account has no password at all. Multiple
[26/06/2017 03:06:17 PM]            -K options can be specified, e.g.: -K UID_MIN=100 -K UID_MAX=499
[26/06/2017 03:06:18 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:18 PM]        -l, --no-log-init
[26/06/2017 03:06:18 PM]            Do not add the user to the lastlog and faillog databases.
[26/06/2017 03:06:18 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:18 PM]            By default, the user큦 entries in the lastlog and faillog databases are resetted to avoid reusing the entry from a previously deleted user.
[26/06/2017 03:06:18 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:18 PM]        -m, --create-home
[26/06/2017 03:06:18 PM]            Create the user큦 home directory if it does not exist. The files and directories contained in the skeleton directory (which can be defined with the -k option)
[26/06/2017 03:06:18 PM]            will be copied to the home directory.
[26/06/2017 03:06:18 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:18 PM]            By default, if this option is not specified and CREATE_HOME is not enabled, no home directories are created.
[26/06/2017 03:06:18 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:18 PM]            The directory where the user큦 home directory is created must exist and have proper SELinux context and permissions. Otherwise the user큦 home directory cannot
[26/06/2017 03:06:18 PM]            be created or accessed.
[26/06/2017 03:06:18 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:19 PM]        -M, --no-create-home
[26/06/2017 03:06:19 PM]            Do not create the user큦 home directory, even if the system wide setting from /etc/login.defs (CREATE_HOME) is set to yes.
[26/06/2017 03:06:19 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:19 PM]        -N, --no-user-group
[26/06/2017 03:06:19 PM]            Do not create a group with the same name as the user, but add the user to the group specified by the -g option or by the GROUP variable in /etc/default/useradd.
[26/06/2017 03:06:19 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:19 PM]            The default behavior (if the -g, -N, and -U options are not specified) is defined by the USERGROUPS_ENAB variable in /etc/login.defs.
[26/06/2017 03:06:19 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:19 PM]        -o, --non-unique
[26/06/2017 03:06:19 PM]            Allow the creation of a user account with a duplicate (non-unique) UID.
[26/06/2017 03:06:20 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:20 PM]            This option is only valid in combination with the -u option.
[26/06/2017 03:06:20 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:21 PM]        -p, --password PASSWORD
[26/06/2017 03:06:21 PM]            The encrypted password, as returned by crypt(3). The default is to disable the password.
[26/06/2017 03:06:21 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:21 PM]            Note: This option is not recommended because the password (or encrypted password) will be visible by users listing the processes.
[26/06/2017 03:06:21 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:22 PM]            You should make sure the password respects the system큦 password policy.
[26/06/2017 03:06:22 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:22 PM]        -r, --system
[26/06/2017 03:06:22 PM]            Create a system account.
[26/06/2017 03:06:22 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:22 PM]            System users will be created with no aging information in /etc/shadow, and their numeric identifiers are chosen in the SYS_UID_MIN-SYS_UID_MAX range, defined in
[26/06/2017 03:06:22 PM]            /etc/login.defs, instead of UID_MIN-UID_MAX (and their GID counterparts for the creation of groups).
[26/06/2017 03:06:22 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:23 PM]            Note that useradd will not create a home directory for such an user, regardless of the default setting in /etc/login.defs (CREATE_HOME). You have to specify the
[26/06/2017 03:06:23 PM]            -m options if you want a home directory for a system account to be created.
[26/06/2017 03:06:23 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:23 PM]        -R, --root CHROOT_DIR
[26/06/2017 03:06:23 PM]            Apply changes in the CHROOT_DIR directory and use the configuration files from the CHROOT_DIR directory.

[26/06/2017 03:06:23 PM]        -s, --shell SHELL
[26/06/2017 03:06:23 PM]            The name of the user큦 login shell. The default is to leave this field blank, which causes the system to select the default login shell specified by the SHELL
[26/06/2017 03:06:23 PM]            variable in /etc/default/useradd, or an empty string by default.
[26/06/2017 03:06:24 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:24 PM]        -u, --uid UID
[26/06/2017 03:06:24 PM]            The numerical value of the user큦 ID. This value must be unique, unless the -o option is used. The value must be non-negative. The default is to use the
[26/06/2017 03:06:24 PM]            smallest ID value greater than or equal to UID_MIN and greater than every other user.
[26/06/2017 03:06:24 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:24 PM]            See also the -r option and the UID_MAX description.
[26/06/2017 03:06:24 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:24 PM]        -U, --user-group
[26/06/2017 03:06:25 PM]            Create a group with the same name as the user, and add the user to this group.
[26/06/2017 03:06:25 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:25 PM]            The default behavior (if the -g, -N, and -U options are not specified) is defined by the USERGROUPS_ENAB variable in /etc/login.defs.
[26/06/2017 03:06:25 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:26 PM]        -Z, --selinux-user SEUSER
[26/06/2017 03:06:26 PM]            The SELinux user for the user큦 login. The default is to leave this field blank, which causes the system to select the default SELinux user.
[26/06/2017 03:06:26 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:26 PM]    Changing the default values
[26/06/2017 03:06:26 PM]        When invoked with only the -D option, useradd will display the current default values. When invoked with -D plus other options, useradd will update the default
[26/06/2017 03:06:26 PM]        values for the specified options. Valid default-changing options are:
[26/06/2017 03:06:27 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:27 PM]        -b, --base-dir BASE_DIR
[26/06/2017 03:06:27 PM]            The path prefix for a new user큦 home directory. The user큦 name will be affixed to the end of BASE_DIR to form the new user큦 home directory name, if the -d
[26/06/2017 03:06:27 PM]            option is not used when creating a new account.
[26/06/2017 03:06:28 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:28 PM]            This option sets the HOME variable in /etc/default/useradd.
[26/06/2017 03:06:28 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:28 PM]        -e, --expiredate EXPIRE_DATE
[26/06/2017 03:06:28 PM]            The date on which the user account is disabled.
[26/06/2017 03:06:29 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:29 PM]            This option sets the EXPIRE variable in /etc/default/useradd.
[26/06/2017 03:06:29 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:29 PM]        -f, --inactive INACTIVE
[26/06/2017 03:06:29 PM]            The number of days after a password has expired before the account will be disabled.
[26/06/2017 03:06:29 PM]

[26/06/2017 03:06:29 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:30 PM]        -g, --gid GROUP
[26/06/2017 03:06:30 PM]            The group name or ID for a new user큦 initial group (when the -N/--no-user-group is used or when the USERGROUPS_ENAB variable is set to no in /etc/login.defs).
[26/06/2017 03:06:30 PM]            The named group must exist, and a numerical group ID must have an existing entry.
[26/06/2017 03:06:30 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:30 PM]            This option sets the GROUP variable in /etc/default/useradd.

[26/06/2017 03:06:30 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:30 PM] NOTES
[26/06/2017 03:06:30 PM]        The system administrator is responsible for placing the default user files in the /etc/skel/ directory (or any other skeleton directory specified in
[26/06/2017 03:06:30 PM]        /etc/default/useradd or on the command line).
[26/06/2017 03:06:30 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:30 PM] CAVEATS
[26/06/2017 03:06:30 PM]        You may not add a user to a NIS or LDAP group. This must be performed on the corresponding server.
[26/06/2017 03:06:30 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:30 PM]        Similarly, if the username already exists in an external user database such as NIS or LDAP, useradd will deny the user account creation request.
[26/06/2017 03:06:30 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:30 PM]        Usernames may only be up to 32 characters long.
[26/06/2017 03:06:30 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:30 PM] CONFIGURATION
[26/06/2017 03:06:30 PM]        The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change the behavior of this tool:
[26/06/2017 03:06:30 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:30 PM]        CREATE_HOME (boolean)
[26/06/2017 03:06:30 PM]            Indicate if a home directory should be created by default for new users.
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM]            This setting does not apply to system users, and can be overridden on the command line.
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM]        GID_MAX (number), GID_MIN (number)
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM]            Range of group IDs used for the creation of regular groups by useradd, groupadd, or newusers.
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM]            The default value for GID_MIN (resp.  GID_MAX) is 500 (resp. 60000).
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM]        MAIL_DIR (string)
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM]            The mail spool directory. This is needed to manipulate the mailbox when its corresponding user account is modified or deleted. If not specified, a compile-time
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM]            default is used.
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM]        MAIL_FILE (string)
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM]            Defines the location of the users mail spool files relatively to their home directory.
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM]        The MAIL_DIR and MAIL_FILE variables are used by useradd, usermod, and userdel to create, move, or delete the user큦 mail spool.
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM]        If MAIL_CHECK_ENAB is set to yes, they are also used to define the MAIL environment variable.
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM]        MAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP (number)
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM]            Maximum members per group entry. When the maximum is reached, a new group entry (line) is started in /etc/group (with the same name, same password, and same
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM]            GID).
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM]            The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits in the number of members in a group.
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:31 PM]            This feature (split group) permits to limit the length of lines in the group file. This is useful to make sure that lines for NIS groups are not larger than
[26/06/2017 03:06:32 PM]            1024 characters.
[26/06/2017 03:06:32 PM] 
[26/06/2017 03:06:32 PM]            If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25.
